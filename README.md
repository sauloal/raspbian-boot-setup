# Purpose

Enhance Raspbian with a mechanism by which *any* host system used to image an SD card can add a setup script to the SD card to initiate a process on first boot.

The mechanism will allow communities to form around Raspbian as the base for special purpose Raspberry Pi configuration without the need to build and host an entire OS. It should be possible to prepare SD cards that initiate a setup process the yields a system that does not need to be further configured by following lengthy explanations found on forums and wikis.

# Practical Applications

1. Set up secured wifi on headless systems
2. Add or remove packages
3. Build and install drivers

# Implementation

1. /etc/rcS.d/S01simple_boot_setup is symlinked to /etc/init.d/simple_boot_setup
2. /etc/init.d/simple_boot_setup calls /boot/simple_boot_setup.sh
2.1. /boot/simple_boot_setup.sh calls /boot/files/simple_boot_setup_0.sh only once (the file gets renamed and not called again)
2.2. /boot/simple_boot_setup.sh calls /boot/files/simple_boot_setup_1.sh at every boot
3. /boot is a FAT file system so that *any* OS can edit it.


# Examples Included

- /etc/networks/interfaces for wifi and cable     - if exists under /file
- /etc/resolve.conf for DNS (google and open dns) - if exists under /file
- ~/pi/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/pi/.ssh/known_hosts      - if exists under /file
- prelimirary attach_devices.py script to auto mount usb and binding desired folders

#### Here are some examples of things you might do...

    ## Remove unneeded packages
    apt-get -y remove --purge xserver-common x11-common gnome-icon-theme gnome-themes-standard penguinspuzzle
    apt-get -y remove --purge desktop-base desktop-file-utils hicolor-icon-theme raspberrypi-artwork omxplayer
    apt-get -y autoremove
    
    ## Install a package that will automatically mount & unmount USB drives
    apt-get install usbmount
    
    ## Setup wifi so you can connect to a secured network without a keyboard & monitor!
    cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.bak
    wpa_passphrase "MyWiFi" "MyPassphrase" | tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    sed -i.bak 's/iface wlan0 inet manual/iface wlan0 inet dhcp/; s/wpa-roam/wpa-conf/; $i auto wlan0 eth0' /etc/network/interfaces

    ## Add your SSH pub key
    (umask 077; mkdir -p ~/.ssh; touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
    chown -R $(id -u pi):$(id -g pi) ~/.ssh
    curl -sL https://raw.github.com/RichardBronosky/dotfiles/master/.ssh/authorized_keys >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

    ## fake completing the raspi-config
    sed '/do_finish()/,/^$/!d' /usr/bin/raspi-config | sed -e '1i ASK_TO_REBOOT=0;' -e '$a do_finish' | bash
